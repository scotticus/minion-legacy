#THE README

Built on [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), so you'll need to have that installed and everything.

Not 100% sure what pieces in here are actually used; sort of just hacked this together over time. Layout is optimized for mobile, so it will probably behave best in "responsive" mode or even in a simulator.
